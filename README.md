# Introduction

This repo contains part of the code written in class during the Advanced Geomatics course in 2024. 

All the code is supposed to work running from QGIS using the [pyqgis scripting extensions](https://pypi.org/project/pyqgis-scripting-ext/) package.

All the code should run by just changing the folder variable to your local path of this repo.

The folder structure is as follows:

* `class-code/`: the code written in class
* `data/`: the data used in the code
* `tmp/`: a folder to store temporary files generated by the code. This folder is not tracked by git and you will need to create it manually
